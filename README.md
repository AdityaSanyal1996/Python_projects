## ShutDown App
This python project is GUI based and it can be used to perfrom a restart(immediate), timed restart (i.e. restart after 20 secs), sign out of windows and shutdown. The output of the project looks like this-

On clicking on any of the given options (say "restart"), the user will be shown another window where the user will able to reassure their decision by either clicking on `yes` or `no`. On clicking `yes` the already selected operation will take place (say restart) and on selecting `no`, the program will stop executing.
